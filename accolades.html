            My team and I were honored with the CS Faculty Choice Award for our capstone 
            project, SafePi: Secure IoT Home Security Solution. SafePi, built from the ground 
            up, included a NodeJS server implementing Oauth2, an Android application for user 
            interaction and device provisioning, and an embedded Linux application on a Raspberry 
            Pi 4b. It's key features and focus were not only on security, but also on the use of 
            Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for the device provisioning and wifi sign-in. For more 
            details see <a class="link" href="https://github.com/Not-Cameron-Inc">THIS LINK</a>.

            As one of ten students in the whole of the California State University, 
            Monterey Bay Population, I was accepted into the Apple Scholars program 
            for undergraduate research. The program aims to support diverse university 
            populations, particularly that of Hispanic/Latinx students, in the STEM fields. 
            The program awards its students with three semesters of funding at $2000 per 
            semester, as well as access to state of the art Apple products. As part of the 
            program requirements I developed this ePortfolio in order to present my work as a 
            researcher, and to keep and maintain into the future as a curated home for my 
            professional brand.

            Participation Program (CSU-LSAMP). This program came with three semester of 
            funding at $1400 each.

            During my senior year at California State University, Monterey Bay, I took on 
            a role as a mentor for transfer and first-year students. Over the course of the year, 
            I mentored four students, forming deep connections and assisting them with campus life, 
            academic stress, and course preparation. I strongly believe in the value of good 
            mentorship as a means to foster a greater sense of community among students.
